# A Bi-Level Cellular Genetic Algorithm Approach to Medical Data Classification - Datasets

This repository contains the preprocessed datasets, used for experiments in the article "A Bi-Level Cellular Genetic Algorithm Approach to Medical Data Classification", by Eng. Matias Gabriel Rojas, PhD. Jessica Andrea Carballido, PhD. Ana Carolina Olivera and PhD. Pablo Javier Vidal.

Nine Different datasets are considered. One of them (thyroid), comes from Keel dataset repository [1]. The remaining are from UCI Machine Learning Repository [2].
